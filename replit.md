```

### Database Models
1. **User** (base class)
   - Polymorphic inheritance for Student and Staff
   - Fields: user_id, username, email, password (hashed), role

2. **Student** (inherits from User)
   - One-to-many with LoggedHours and Request
   - Can request hours, view accolades, check leaderboard

3. **Staff** (inherits from User)
   - One-to-many with LoggedHours
   - Can approve/deny student hour requests

4. **Request**
   - Student hour confirmation requests
   - Statuses: pending, approved, denied

5. **LoggedHours**
   - Approved hours for students
   - Linked to both student and approving staff member

6. **Activity**
   - Activity history tracking for students

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
The application runs automatically in Replit. The workflow is configured to run:
```bash
gunicorn -c gunicorn_config.py wsgi:app
```

### Initialization
To initialize/reset the database:
```bash
flask init
```

### Flask CLI Commands
Available commands for managing the application:

#### General Commands

- `flask listUsers` - List all users
- `flask listStaff` - List all staff members
- `flask listStudents` - List all students
- `flask listRequests` - List all requests
- `flask listApprovedRequests` - List approved requests
- `flask listPendingRequests` - List pending requests
- `flask listDeniedRequests` - List denied requests
- `flask listloggedHours` - List all logged hours

#### Student Commands
- `flask student create` - Create a new student
- `flask student hours` - View total approved hours
- `flask student requestHours` - Request hour confirmation

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The application uses the following configuration:
- `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` - Database connection (default: SQLite)
- `SECRET_KEY` - Flask secret key for sessions
- Port 5000 is used for the web server (required for Replit)

### Default Configuration
Located in `App/default_config.py`:
- SQLite database: `sqlite:///temp-database.db`
- Secret key: Set in config (should be changed for production)

Custom configuration can be added via `App/custom_config.py` (takes precedence over default).

## Key Features
1. **Student Hour Tracking**: Students submit hours for approval
2. **Staff Review Workflow**: Staff can approve/deny requests with automatic hour logging
3. **Accolades System**: Students earn recognition based on hours (10, 25, 50 hour milestones)
4. **Leaderboard**: Ranking system based on approved hours with progress bars
5. **Activity History**: Track student progress over time with milestone tracking
6. **CLI Interface**: Comprehensive command-line tools
7. **Web Interface**: Modern responsive UI with purple theme
8. **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with cookie/header support, role-based access
9. **Admin Panel**: Flask-Admin integration for data management

- Password hashing via Werkzeug
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- Gevent workers for async performance
- Flask-Migrate for database migrations
- Comprehensive test coverage with pytest

## User Preferences
- None specified yet

## Sample Data

- 5 sample students (alice, bob, charlie, diana, eve)
- 3 sample staff members (msmith, mjohnson, mlee)
- 4 sample hour requests
- 2 approved requests with logged hours
- 1 denied request
- 1 pending request
